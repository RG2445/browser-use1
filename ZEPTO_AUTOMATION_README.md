# Zepto Invoice Automation - Improved Version

## Problem Analysis

The original script had several issues that caused it to fail after downloading May invoices:

1. **Single Agent Complexity**: One massive agent trying to handle login, navigation, and downloads for all three months
2. **Poor State Management**: No browser session persistence between operations
3. **Error Propagation**: Any failure in one month would break the entire process
4. **Lack of Progress Tracking**: No clear indication of what was completed
5. **Rigid Task Structure**: Overly complex prompt that was hard for AI to follow consistently

## Key Improvements

### 1. Task Decomposition ✅
- **Before**: Single 400+ line task prompt
- **After**: 4 separate, focused agents:
  - Login agent (navigation to invoices page)
  - May download agent
  - June download agent  
  - July download agent

### 2. Better State Management ✅
- **Before**: `Browser(browser_profile=browser_profile)`
- **After**: `BrowserSession(browser_profile=browser_profile)`
- Maintains browser state and cookies between agent runs
- Prevents session loss and re-login requirements

### 3. Error Isolation ✅
- **Before**: Failure in May breaks June and July
- **After**: Each month handled independently
- Better error handling with try/catch blocks
- Clear progress reporting for each step

### 4. Improved User Experience ✅
- Clear progress indicators for each step
- Pauses between months to ensure stability
- Better error messages and completion summaries
- Browser remains open for manual verification

### 5. More Reliable Agent Parameters ✅
- Reduced `max_actions_per_step` from 10 to 6-8 for better focus
- Appropriate `max_steps` for each agent type
- Maintained `use_vision=True` for UI interaction

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Fix (Recommended)
Replace your original script with `zepto_automation_working.py`:

```python
# Your original script imports and setup remain the same
# Just replace the run_download() function implementation
```

### Environment Setup
Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```env
zepto_url=your_zepto_portal_url
zepto_email=your_email_address
zepto_password=your_password
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### Running the Script
```bash
python zepto_automation_working.py
```

## What's Fixed

### Issue: "doesn't work properly after downloading for May"

**Root Cause**: The original script used a single browser instance without session persistence. After May downloads, the browser state was lost or corrupted.

**Solution**: 
- Use `BrowserSession` instead of `Browser`
- Break tasks into separate agents
- Add proper state management between months

### Issue: Complex task prompt causing AI confusion

**Root Cause**: 400+ line prompt with nested instructions was too complex for consistent AI execution.

**Solution**:
- Separate login, May, June, July into distinct focused tasks
- Clear success criteria for each step
- Reduced cognitive load per agent

### Issue: No error recovery

**Root Cause**: Single agent failure broke entire process.

**Solution**:
- Independent agents for each month
- Try/catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- Graceful degradation and manual intervention points

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Login Flow**: Run just the login portion first
2. **Test Single Month**: Comment out June/July to test May only
3. **Monitor Downloads**: Check downloads folder after each month
4. **Manual Verification**: Use the browser-open pause to verify results

## Browser Use Library Best Practices Applied

1. **Use BrowserSession**: For persistent state across multiple agents
2. **Task Decomposition**: Break complex workflows into focused agents
3. **Appropriate Parameters**: Right-sized max_actions_per_step and max_steps
4. **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling and user feedback
5. **Vision Enabled**: Maintained use_vision=True for UI interactions

## Future Improvements

1. **Resume Capability**: Save progress and allow resuming from specific months
2. **Parallel Downloads**: Download multiple pages concurrently
3. **Better Completion Detection**: Parse agent responses for "No Data found"
4. **Configuration File**: Move settings to external config
5. **Logging**: Add detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure stable internet connection for OTP verification
4. Check downloads folder permissions
5. Consider running with headless=False to debug visually

The improved script should reliably complete all three months of downloads without the issues experienced in the original version.
